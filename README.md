# Welcome to Habit Hunter!

I made this application because I wanted a simple habit tracker that just allows me to log on quickly every day when I sit down in my office and mark habits as done.

After reading [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/), I became fascinated with habit formation. That lead me to changing the structure of my daily life and eventually the creation of this app.

Studies show that it takes [66 days](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit) on average to form a new long term habit. By keeping track of your habit streaks you make it more likely to reach the 66 day mark.

I have purposely made it so that once a habit is marked as done it cannot be undone for the day because I found that I got into the routine of marking everything as done in the morning, and then going back at night and undoing the ones that I didn't get to. This resulted in bad habit formation.

# How to use the app

Go to [www.habitHunter.io](https://www.habithunter.io/)

1. Log in with your Google or Github SSO.

- We do not collect any user data and do not store any information other than the email associated with your sign on of choice.
- We will also never send any emails or spam, nor will we share the email address with any other platform for any reason.

2. Add a habit that you want to track via the add button.
3. If you accidentally add a habit, or no longer want to track a habit then you can choose to delete it via the 'x' in the top right. Deleting a habit will also delete all associated data.
4. Log on daily to mark down which habits you've completed

# Planned future releases

I have plenty of features that I would like to add, if you have any other suggestions feel fee to email me (elliot.adinolfi@gmail.com) and I'll add it to this list

1. Pausing habits to not lose your streak. If you go on vacation or something comes up, you shouldn't lose your streak.

2. Selecting which days of the week a habit should be tracked. I go to the gym 5 days per week, the streak shouldn't be broken from not going on weekends, nor should I have to press pause on Friday and start it back up on Monday.

3. Showing scores. I love video games, and the more that I can gamify this project and make it more fun/interesting, the more likely I, and I'm sure others, are to use it daily.

4. Similarly, I want to set up an achievement system. I mentioned above that it takes 66 days to form a long term habit, you should be recognized for making it to that milestone.

5. Reordering habits. If one is more important to you than the rest, being able to move it to the top spot is a nice QOL change.
